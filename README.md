# SimpleQuizMaker
  An extremely simplistic quiz form maker that takes input on the command line and spits out a flat HTML file with a primitive form. CSS file included to dress it up as desired. Structure is standard Maven Java project.

  It just creates a front-end flat file, no other functionality (such as grading) yet.
